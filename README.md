This software is complimentary to the Sysmaster's IPTV servers.

channels locally (supports all major dekstop browsers, Chrome on Android and
Safari mobile on iOS 6+) and cast them (supported on Chrome for Desktop with
installed Cast extention and Android via a dedicatedly built APK based on this
source code).
